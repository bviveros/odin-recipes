        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>
            Mac and Cheese, short for macaroni and cheese, is a classic comfort food beloved for its creamy texture and cheesy goodness.
        </p>
    
        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Macaroni Pasta: Elbow-shaped pasta is the traditional choice, but other pasta shapes can be used. </li>
            <li> Cheese: A combination of cheeses is often used, including cheddar, mozzarella, and/or Monterey Jack. The cheese can be grated or melted to create a smooth, creamy sauce. </li>
            <li> Milk or Cream: To achieve the desired creamy consistency. </li>
            <li> Butter: Adds richness and enhances the flavor of the cheese sauce. </li>
            <li> Flour: Used as a thickening agent for the cheese sauce. </li>
            <li> Salt and Pepper: Seasonings to enhance the overall taste. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Cooking the Pasta: The macaroni pasta is boiled in salted water until it reaches an al dente texture. It is then drained and set aside. </li>
            <li> Cheese Sauce: In a separate saucepan, a roux is often created by melting butter and mixing in flour. Milk or cream is gradually added to the roux, creating a smooth base for the cheese sauce. Grated cheese is then slowly incorporated, melting into the mixture to form a creamy, cheesy sauce. Seasoning with salt and pepper adds depth of flavor. </li>
            <li> Combining Pasta and Sauce: The cooked macaroni is then mixed into the cheese sauce until each pasta piece is coated in the creamy goodness. </li>
            <li> Baking (Optional): Some variations of mac and cheese involve baking the dish, either with a breadcrumb topping for added crunch or simply to achieve a bubbly, golden finish. </li>
        </ol>
